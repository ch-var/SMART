SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models) is a publicly available open-source spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code. Implementing a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, SMART fits the ultraviolet to millimetre SEDs of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models that currently constitute four types of pre-computed libraries, which describe the starburst, active galactic nucleus (AGN), host galaxy and polar dust components. SMART promises to be a useful tool for studying galaxy evolution in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era.
